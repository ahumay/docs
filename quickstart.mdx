### Installation

**Invitation-Only Distribution:**  
Access to the TAMC client libraries is granted on an invitation-only basis. If you have been invited to use TAMC’s Super Model Router, you should have received instructions to install the package from our private repository. For example, if you are using Python, you might install the package using:

```bash
pip install tmac --extra-index-url https://pypi.tmac.com/simple
```

For JavaScript/Node.js, please follow the instructions provided in your invitation email.

### Python Example

```python
from tmac import TAMCClient

# Initialize the client (authentication details may be required)
client = TAMCClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define your query message
messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": "Write merge sort in 3 lines."}
]

# Specify the list of LLM providers (managed by TAMC)
llm_providers = [
    "openai/gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
    "openai/gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09",
    "google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest",
    "anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
]

# Call the TAMC router endpoint to get the best-suited model's response
result, session_id, selected_provider = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=messages,
    model=llm_providers
)

print("Session ID:", session_id)
print("Selected LLM:", selected_provider.model)
print("Response:", result.content)
```

### JavaScript/Node.js Example

```javascript
const { TAMCClient } = require("tmac");

// Initialize the client with your API key
const client = new TAMCClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "Explain how quantum genomics works." }
];

const llmProviders = [
    "{model goes here}",
];

// Request a response from the TAMC router
client.chat.completions.create({ messages, model: llmProviders })
  .then(({ result, session_id, selected_provider }) => {
      console.log("Session ID:", session_id);
      console.log("Selected LLM:", selected_provider.model);
      console.log("Response:", result.content);
  })
  .catch(error => {
      console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```
