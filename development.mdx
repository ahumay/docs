To begin using TAMC’s Super Model Router, you need to obtain a unique TAMC API key. Access is granted on an invitation-only basis. If you haven’t received an invitation, please contact [ahumay@americanmodel.co](mailto:ahumay@americanmodel.co).

# LLM Provider API Keys

TAMC’s Super Model Router is designed as a client-side recommendation tool. All requests to LLMs are executed on your side using your own API keys. The TAMC service recommends the optimal model based on your input, but you remain in full control of your keys for each provider. For a complete list of supported LLMs, please see [Supported LLMs](doc:llm-models). You can sign up for API keys from the major providers in minutes:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` 
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` 
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

Alternatively, you can use the `best` method to receive model recommendations from TAMC and then call the selected models in your own environment.
